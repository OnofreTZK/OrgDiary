#+begin_quote
Why are people so susceptible to inaccuracies, lies, and oddball theories like these?

While that question might sound like it has a deep, complex answer, the reality is a
lot of it can be chalked up to the simplest of things: *misunderstood words*.

That's why learning the precise meanings of key words is the first major hurdle you have
to clear when you're trying to learn something new if you're going to have any hope of
gaining a deep and practical understanding of it.

** Notes
 * Don't underestimate the destructive power of misunderstanding the basics of something
   you're trying to learn and apply.

*** Amino Acid
 * An amino acid is a naturally ocurring compound found in proteins.

*** Protein
 * Is a naturally occuring compound that's composed of one or more long chains of amino acids.

   order to maintain life.
 * Involves the production of energy as well as the creation, maintenance, and destruction
   of cells and tissues.

*** Anabolism
 * Is a metabolic process in a organism by which energy is used to make more complex
   substances(such as tissue) from simpler ones(such as protein).
   + This is also known as constructive metabolism.
 
*** Catabolism
 * Is the metabolic process by which more complex substances(such as proteins) are broken
   down into simpler ones(such as amino acids), together with the release of energy.
   + This is also known as destructive metabolism.

*** Healthy
 * If a body is healthy, it has good strength and high energy levels and is free from pain,
   ilness, damage, and dysfunction.
 * If something is healthy, it's beneficial to one's physical, mental, or emotional state.

*** Nutrient

 * Is a form of carbohydrate that breaks down quickly into glucose in the body.
   + Fructose, lactose, and sucrose are simple carbohydrates.

*** Complex Carbohydrate
 * Is a form of carbohydrate consisting of a chain of simple carbohydrates linked together.
